There are both Python and IPython notebook files in the zip file.

The source files for q1 and q2 since there might be similar variable names that might confuse python interpreter.

I originally worked on the notebook files and I recommend you to do so. You may also find outputs in the notebook files.
To run them, I guess you will need pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, PIL installed (I have anaconda3 and I guess
it handled downloads for me). You can also run using plain python by using "python3 q1.py" and "python3 q2.py" I believe, but honestly, I did not try. I did not include
dataset files, but if you add them to same folder as the source code, it should work properly. The dog images must be in a folder
named afhq_dog.
