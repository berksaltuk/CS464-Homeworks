There are both Python and IPython notebook files in the zip file.

I strongly recommend you to run the notebook file on Google Colab where
I also trained my models. To achieve this you can upload this notebook file
to your own Drive and connect your Drive account. You can upload datasets to
a folder called "CS464" that is located in your root Drive folder. 

If you want to run the Python script, I believe you can simply run the command
"python3 q2main.py". I slightly changed the content of Python script so that
it will not try to connect Google Drive. To run this from command line you will need
python3, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and numpy. Moreover, you should keep the dataset
files in the same folder with the script file. For your information, I did not try running like this, this is why I am strongly recommending the other way :D
